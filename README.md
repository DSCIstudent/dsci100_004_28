# Project Final Report

The Pacific Laboratory for Artifical Intelligence (PLAI) is research group in computer science at UBC. They have Minecraft server, called PLAIcraft, where they record player's actions as they navigate through the virtual world. The research group would like to target their PLAIcraft recruitment efforts and ensure they have enough resources to handle the number of players they attract. 

In this report, we explore the question "*What kinds of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data?*"
Specifically, our group is interested in learning about how *player age* might be related to how much data they contribute (i.e. *total played hours*).
