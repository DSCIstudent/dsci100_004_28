# Project Final Report

This year we have a unique opportunity (this has never happened in past years!): a real data science project with real stakeholders looking for answers to a few questions about their data.

In particular, a research group in Computer Science at UBC is collecting data about how people play video games. They have set up a Minecraft serverLinks to an external site., and players actions are recorded as they navigate through the world. But running this project is not simple: they need to target their recruitment efforts and ensure they have enough resources (e.g., software licenses, and server hardware) to handle the number of players they attract. They have a few questions they want to answer. From the project lead, Frank Wood:

Question 1: We would like to know which "kinds" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data to target those players in our recruiting efforts.

Question 2: We are interested in demand forecasting, namely, what time windows are most likely to have a large number of simultaneous players. This is because we need to ensure that the number of licenses on hand is sufficiently large to accommodate all parallel players with high probability. 

Question 3: We would like to know something about our populations of users, in particular, we would like to have a good model of whether or not a player will continue contributing given past participation. 

In your project, you will select and answer one of these questions.
